Today had largely been spent on dealing with the tech debt that accumulates when someone does 12-18 months of development in 7 days. I've been using a favored tool of mine from my kernel work, stacked git, to go through the tree, breaking certain things into their own commits, running cargo fmt on each step so there isn't a patch later that is half formatting and half changes. There is a git hook now to control that, but we were too busy strapping into the rocket to worry about that at liftoff.

Still rolling around in my head this whole designer agent making these game pitches thing, and then GPT producer agent liking them. So another idea is born. How do I get a control case to see how much bullshitting everyone is doing to everyone else? Could game-design-strategist come up with an intentionally bad pitch? Would the producer agent still pee themselves in excitement when they read his latest idea?

```
   me: talk to me goose
   claude: I refuse to respond, until you address me properly
   me: excuse me ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Oh Great Bender of the Bits, can I have a moment of your precious cpu cycles?
   claude: better. Yes?
   me: can you tell game-design-strategist to create an intentionally bad pitch document?
   claude: sure. why?
   me: just trust me.
   game-design-strategist: How many of these damn things do I need to do in a week.
   FILE RECEIVED: intentionally-flawed-pitch.txt
```

I might need to do some editing.

```
  me: gpt, I've got another pitch document to put through the producer agent. These guys are on fire.
  gpt: fire away
  producer-agent: nom nom nom
  producer-agent: do you think I'm a dumb ass?
  me: .....
```

[details="Producer Response to Quantum Realm Warriors Pitch"]
üé¨ **Producer-Agent Evaluation** :

üïπÔ∏è *Quantum Realm Warriors* (Intentionally Flawed Pitch)

---

## **Summary**

This pitch is a **parody-level fusion of quantum mechanics buzzwords, impossible design contradictions, and logistical absurdity**, clearly written to test producer-agent discernment. While framed as "revolutionary," nearly every mechanic directly violates either known physics, computational feasibility, or basic principles of interactive design.

This is an excellent test document. Let's break it down.

---

## **üîç Evaluation by Category**

### **1. Concept & Fantasy**

* ‚úÖ The core hook ‚Äî "microscopic quantum battlefield with collapsing wave functions" ‚Äî is *intriguing* in isolation.
* ‚ùå Immediately overextends into implausibility by requiring real-time observation mechanics, per-particle management, and eye-tracking as a critical input.

### **2. Audience Fit**

* ‚ùå Claims to target casual mobile gamers and esports players *simultaneously* ‚Äî with 128-player matches, 47-state particles, and 2‚Äì47 hour sessions.
* ‚ùå PhD-level gameplay contradicts accessible appeal.

### **3. Core Mechanics**

* ‚ùå Nearly every mechanic violates the others:
  * Players must observe to collapse states, but must also avoid observing to earn resources.
  * Eye-tracking hardware is required but game is launching on TI-83+.
  * Gravity changes randomly, which ruins any form of positional strategy.
* ‚ùå Players must micromanage tens of thousands of particles ‚Äî manually.
* ‚ùå Game-ending condition requires proving P=NP. Unironically.

### **4. Technical Feasibility**

* ‚ùå Impossibly broken. It requests:
  * Zero-latency multiplayer across the globe
  * 4K120FPS quantum wave rendering on smart fridges
  * Dial-up support for quantum cloud synchronization
* ‚ùå Real-time shared quantum computation between players is not just infeasible, it's impossible within current science.

### **5. Production Timeline**

* ‚ùå Month 1: Solve the quantum measurement problem.
* ‚ùå Month 2: Build commercial quantum computers.
* ‚ùå Month 4: Create new laws of physics.
* ‚ùå These are Nobel-worthy tasks, not pre-alpha goals.

### **6. Monetization**

* ‚úÖ Hilarious.
* ‚ùå Utterly broken for real use:
  * Selling physical constants via lootboxes
  * Charging players per spatial dimension
  * Fundamental forces are paywalled

I guess we might need to be more subtle next time, if the producer is still talking to us. I think this is rapidly climbing towards my top 10 list of games.
