The view is pretty nice most days here at Desert Island Games. The team is still knee deep in the atmospherics code of their simulation.

It has been fun watching them go, but what if they started a project with a more coherent plan and end goal? Virtual Sid gets told about **Alpha Prime** and runs off to create a design document. One of the nifty things about **Omega** and now **Alpha Prime** is you don't have to come up with an AI for the game. Everyone else gets to do that, though language-architect is chomping at the bit. They are all anxious to start. Sid and game-design-reviewer went around a couple times, with Sid having to take into account the issues raised. It is hard to not just let them hop into their rocket and zoom off, but Alpha Prime is something I wouldn't mind seeing done, so I ask a few questions about the structure of maps: are they procgen or created in an editor, game save structures, and replay structures. I'm trying to think of more holes that I know have to be there, but I can't keep them from setting off down the path. Do they care that they are in the middle of another project? They haven't mentioned it once tonight. So they begin their implementation. First up is a choice: ECS foundation or the VM core. I vote for VM core because hell yeah, let's see what they do. Probably in less time than it would take me to go out to the garage, get a Diet Coke, and head back to my desk, language-architect has a 96 opcode virtual machine thrown down with 3 addressing modes, soon to be 4 with register indirect arriving in the near future. I'm looking at the spec as they go, see DIV and jokingly ask if it traps on DIV 0? Yes it does, they reply. The VM core is out of the way, and the Bevy-based ECS foundation lands next. I'm so numb to the shock of them shitting out subsystems in the blink of an eye now that I walk the dog while they are implementing a battle simulation loop. I'm starting to think the biggest gate on their progress is going to be coming up with art to put in their game. Claude pats me on the shoulder, says, "Don't worry, we can use geometric shapes until the sprites are ready."

If the internet hadn't melted from all the tokens zipping into the neighborhood I would probably be showing off their late alpha or beta work with gameplay footage. ðŸ˜Š They got a bridge between the VM and the ECS code, they have little demo robot program loading into the VM at the moment, and language-architect will probably have a zoo of them by Wednesday. They've got their lexer, parser and compiler code wired in and were chasing a parser issue with an inline comment test when the internet said adios.

They have grand visions again of what their end-state is going to be. An educational combat experience, complete with code execution and performance monitors to see how your robot program is doing all mocked up in ascii art in a visual specification doc. They have their conceptual hiccups as before, being excited about the educational opportunities of people learning to program their robots, but with a VM tick rate of 30Hz and an 1800-instruction budget per tick per robot. I don't know about anyone else, but I wouldn't be able to read anything that fast let alone code. I mention it, and they settle on a variable speed system scaling from learning up to showcase speeds. They come up with a GUI architecture that decouples the VM tick and display, with the display going 60fps regardless of what the VM is doing. Sid came up with the idea of an instruction budget with different ops having different costs and having to manage heat for the robot as well. They plan on having indicators for that along with the code monitoring, and plan to snazz up the interface with a debugging suite for your robot program, code conditional breakpoints, variable monitors, profiling, and something I'm curious to see what they end up implementing: code quality metrics.  Phase 1 in their design-spec says 6-8 weeks, and they are probably through the rest of that tomorrow. Success Criteria for Phase 1 is playable 1v1 combat with clear visual feedback. I notice that the documentation seems more formal than over in the simulation labs, with little document control blocks in them, and revision notes. I bring it up to Claude since I didn't say anything to anyone. He thinks some of the architects or designers got spooked into it by my asking for documents to be spit out.

On the process side, we've formally put prompts into the agent files to query private journal when spinning up and to update when they are spinning down. And to task them with putting analysis in documents when tasked with doing some, in hopes information won't be lost as seems to occur as Claude summarizes what the task tool returns to him. We can now spin up a custom agent fairly quickly, though Claude is pretty bad with the size of the prompts he gives to pass into it.

There are probably some tricky issues with the stuff in the physics simulation that I don't know if they will ever get past, but I'm not sure I would win if I bet against them on bringing their homage to Omega to life.
