They continue to plug away at it. We've finally managed to come close to a usage limit, so everyone is taking a break. We've also started to skip the agent creator mechanism and have Claude create the agent prompt files directly. It required a restart of Claude Code for them to be visible, but it was a quick way to add the project agents he thought he would need to finish a little project for us. The project is another MCP server—this time it has the job of connecting to an instance of SageMath running in a Docker instance so quant geek can do some math in there. lol. We'll see how it goes.

Once the usage resets in about an hour, they will be back at work. One crew continues to rework the math in Alpha Prime, the other group finishes the last bits of the MCP server, and me—dreaming of other things that I could interface to Claude Code so the agents have other tools to use.
