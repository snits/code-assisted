**Breakthrough in BSville?**

*middle aged man walking in the dry Arizona heat of summer*

So I'm walking our dog, pondering the comments from @Nightgaunt and how to frame a prompt for an experiment to generate internal pitch-style responses.

<div class="terminal-output">
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> God this heat sucks .... <i>thinking about the agent system they started to implement</i><br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> 300 agents .... 300 agents x 60fps .... why are they talking about 300 agents at 60fps when they're crafting this planetary-level simulation? Why are they planning to update agent state 60 times a second? Is the simulation tick rate 60hz? Have I maybe found a weakness?
</div><br> 

This project here has been far closer to the vibe coding end of the scale than the stuff I've done related to work. I'm looking superficially at changes they're doing and helping them make some conceptual leaps when debugging, but largely just sitting back and watching it unfold. So this project wasn't supposed to be tied to a game, and isn't really‚Äîit's still just a stupid toy thing to play around with algorithms used in simulation and procedural generation, to experiment with the sub-agent technology and inject/overlay some structured process to it, and to try nutty crap like the game pitch stuff that pops in my head as I sit here. It is a cycle of having them move forward on something, pondering things, and trying to come back here with an update so I don't get too out of sync, because they move along pretty fast. 

So it didn't quite register when I first saw it float up the terminal window. They have grandiose ideas of agent behavioral simulation stuff, and they're talking about 300 agents. Obviously there are technical constraints, but it was an interesting comment that I think that came from an agent named game-performance-agent, whose task was to assess the system and its feasibility, and it didn't seem to be flagged. A quick look at the prompt, which was a refined one from a model, shows that it mentions simulation feasibility for game constraints. So that explains why the 60fps got involved. Shot myself in the foot, I guess, instead of a prompt focused on simulation‚Äîbut what are the agents supposed to represent in a simulation where you're doing planetary physics? Most likely the answer is you shouldn't be doing anything in a planetary physics simulation with agents, but there are grandiose ideas of biomes driving cultural mythologies. I had a couple crazy ideas for them to noodle over: could they do their "professional-grade" planetary simulation for initial map generation and zoom into the smaller region of the map to play with their agents, or can they have 300 agents where the agents represent a different cultural entity depending on map scale, so nation/faction -> tribe/settlement -> individual something. 

An interesting thing to note is that I bring something like that up, and they're supposed to shoot down crazy shit, but no one has ever shot down any idea I've ever posed. I guess I have some new experiments to try. I mean, this whole project is crazy‚Äîfrom the conceptual details to the fact I am using English language to get a program to shit out 6000+ lines of Rust code that compiles and puts something on the screen. I create a rust-specialist agent, and it goes through their codebase, lols at their height-map storage solution, and apparently gives them a 2-3x performance boost with its cleanup. All because of this initial prompt. WTAF?

Anyway, it's still interesting to see what they're doing, and it will be interesting to see how they act when they're constrained with a real game design. So where are we going to get a real game design to try? Thanks @Nightgaunt üòä

```
Agent/Biome System Performance Analysis

Core Finding: The system can support 300 agents at 60fps with proper optimization.<br><br>Critical Bottleneck Identified

* Query Volume: 300 agents √ó 60fps = 18,000+ biome queries per second
* Problem: Random BiomeMap access breaks Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) optimization
* Impact: Scattered biome queries saturate memory bandwidth

Solution Architecture<br><br>Agent-Level Biome Caching:

current_biomes: Vec&lt;BiomeType&gt;,    // 1 byte per agent (hot data)
biome_update_timers: Vec&lt;u8&gt;,      // Update countdown

Performance Improvements:

- Query Reduction: 18,000/sec ‚Üí ~1,800/sec (90% reduction)
- Cache Preservation: Biome data stays in agent hot memory
- Frame Budget: &lt;1ms for biome updates, &lt;5ms total agent processing

60fps Frame Budget (16.67ms total)

- Agent Processing: 5-8ms (movement, behavior, social systems)
- Biome Integration: &lt;1ms (cached queries)
- Terrain Updates: 2-5ms
- Rendering: 3-5ms
- Buffer: 2-3ms

Scaling Analysis

- 300 Agents: Proven feasible with current optimizations
- 500+ Agents: Requires hierarchical spatial indexing
- 1000+ Agents: Needs parallel processing for behavior updates

# Multi-Scale Social Dynamics for Agent Systems
ABOUTME: Analysis of social behaviors, relationships, and cooperation mechanics across individual, tribal, and national scales for agent-based simulation systems.
ABOUTME: Provides practical framework for implementing emergent social dynamics that create meaningful player experiences through multi-scale interaction.
## Social Behaviors at Each Scale
### Individual Scale (Personal Agency)
  At the individual level, agents exhibit personal motivations, emotional responses, and direct relationship management. Behaviors center around immediate needs (survival, comfort, social connection) and personal goal pursuit. Decision-making is highly contextual and emotionally driven, with agents forming strong preferences and grudges based on direct interactions. Trust and reputation operate through personal experience and face-to-face encounters.
  Social behaviors include gift-giving, personal favors, romantic relationships, mentorship, and rivalry. Agents maintain detailed mental models of other individuals, tracking personal history, emotional bonds, and reciprocal obligations. The social cognitive load is manageable because agents interact with dozens, not hundreds, of other individuals regularly.
### Tribal Scale (Community Belonging)
  Tribal dynamics introduce group identity, shared culture, and collective decision-making. Behaviors shift toward group cohesion, role specialization, and maintaining community standards. Agents begin thinking in terms of "us vs them," developing loyalty to their group while potentially showing suspicion toward outsiders. Leadership emerges naturally based on competence, charisma, or tradition.
  Social mechanisms include collective rituals, shared resource management, group decision-making councils, and enforcement of social norms. Reputation becomes partially inherited from group membership. Agents balance personal desires against community expectations, creating tension between individual agency and social conformity that drives compelling narrative conflicts.
### National Scale (Abstract Allegiance)
  National-level behaviors involve abstract loyalty to institutions, symbols, and ideologies rather than personal relationships. Agents develop patriotism, political opinions, and attitudes toward foreign nations based on cultural narratives rather than direct experience. Decision-making becomes influenced by propaganda, historical grievances, and perceived national interests that may conflict with personal or tribal loyalties.
  Social behaviors include voting, military service, tax compliance, and participation in national ceremonies. Agents form opinions about distant leaders they'll never meet and support policies affecting people they'll never encounter. The scale creates opportunities for manipulation by charismatic leaders and ideological movements, adding layers of political intrigue to the simulation.

## Relationship Systems Appropriate for Each Scale

### Individual Relationships

Personal relationships require high-resolution tracking of emotional bonds, shared experiences, and reciprocal obligations. The system should model friendship levels, romantic attraction, family bonds, mentor-student relationships, and personal rivalries. Each relationship has unique history, emotional valence, and behavioral expectations that influence how agents interact.

Relationship dynamics include gradual trust building through positive interactions, betrayal consequences that permanently alter bonds, and emotional contagion where agent moods affect their social network. The system needs to handle relationship triangles, where Agent A's relationship with Agent B affects their relationship with Agent C, creating complex social webs.

### Tribal Relationships

Tribal relationships operate through role-based interactions and group membership hierarchies. Agents relate to each other partially through their positions within the community - chief, shaman, warrior, craftsperson - with relationships defined by traditional obligations and expectations. Group dynamics include coalition formation, factional disputes, and collective identity reinforcement.

The system should track group cohesion metrics, leadership legitimacy, and internal tensions that could lead to group splitting or exile of problematic members. Relationships become partially institutionalized, where personal feelings are tempered by social roles and community expectations.

### National Relationships

National relationships are largely symbolic and ideological. Agents develop attitudes toward abstract entities like "the crown," "the church," or "the republic" based on cultural programming rather than personal interaction. These relationships are maintained through rituals, symbols, and shared narratives rather than face-to-face contact.

The system needs to model how agents form political loyalties, respond to national crises, and balance competing allegiances when tribal and national interests conflict. Agents may simultaneously love their local community while distrusting the distant capital, creating rich opportunities for political drama.

## Cooperation Mechanics That Change Across Scales

### Individual Cooperation

Individual cooperation relies on direct reciprocity and personal trust. Agents help each other based on friendship, family bonds, or explicit agreements for future reciprococation. Cooperation is highly contextual and relationship-dependent - agents readily help close friends but may refuse identical requests from strangers or enemies.

Mechanisms include favor trading, resource sharing based on personal relationships, collaborative problem-solving between trusted partners, and mutual protection agreements. Defection has immediate personal consequences, making cooperation enforcement relatively straightforward through social feedback and relationship damage.

### Tribal Cooperation

Tribal cooperation introduces group norms, social pressure, and reputation-based enforcement. Agents cooperate to maintain group membership and avoid social sanctions. The community can enforce cooperative behavior through shame, exclusion, or loss of status, making defection costly even when direct victims cannot retaliate.

Cooperation mechanisms include collective work projects, resource pooling for community benefit, group defense against external threats, and enforcement of social contracts through peer pressure. Free-rider problems are managed through social surveillance and community sanctions that make selfish behavior publicly visible and socially costly.

### National Cooperation

National cooperation relies on abstract institutions, legal systems, and ideological commitment rather than personal relationships or social pressure. Agents cooperate with strangers based on shared identity and institutional trust rather than personal knowledge. Enforcement mechanisms include legal punishment, bureaucratic oversight, and patriotic duty.

The system should model how agents balance national obligations against personal and tribal loyalties. National cooperation is fragile because it depends on institutional legitimacy and shared belief in abstract principles that can be undermined by corruption, military defeat, or ideological challenges.

## Social Events That Should Propagate Between Scales

### Upward Propagation (Individual ‚Üí Tribal ‚Üí National)

Personal conflicts can escalate into tribal feuds when family honor is at stake, potentially drawing entire communities into warfare. A gifted individual's innovations or discoveries can transform tribal capabilities and eventually influence national power. Personal relationships between leaders from different groups can prevent or cause larger conflicts based on private trust or animosity.

Individual moral choices can become tribal legends that reinforce cultural values and eventually contribute to national mythology. A single agent's exceptional courage, treachery, or innovation can ripple upward through storytelling and cultural transmission, affecting group identity at progressively larger scales.

### Downward Propagation (National ‚Üí Tribal ‚Üí Individual)

National policies and crises force tribal leaders to make difficult choices that affect community survival and individual lives. War declarations mean tribal young adults face military conscription, separating families and disrupting local communities. Economic policies from distant capitals can destroy local industries, forcing agents to migrate or adapt their lifestyles.

National ideological shifts can challenge tribal traditions, creating generational conflicts within communities as younger agents adopt new beliefs while elders defend traditional ways. Religious or political movements spreading from national centers can fracture local communities along ideological lines, turning neighbors into opponents.

### Cross-Scale Resonance Events

Some events simultaneously affect all scales, creating system-wide social upheaval. Natural disasters require immediate individual survival responses, strain tribal resources and decision-making, and test national institutional capacity. Technological innovations change personal capabilities, disrupt traditional tribal roles, and alter national military or economic power.

Religious revelations or prophetic movements can inspire individual spiritual transformation, challenge tribal authority structures, and threaten national political stability simultaneously. These cross-scale events create the most dramatic and memorable gameplay moments because they force agents to navigate conflicting loyalties and rapidly changing social landscapes across all relationship levels.

And here are the 6 ideas virtual Sid, virtual Will, and virtual Dani came back with. I initially wanted them to go round and round and hash out a ranked list to present to the team. The sonnet model thought it wouldn't work due to deferring to others (?), but liked my idea of the team ranking them since they were supposed to be made to pitch to the team.

  <summary>Memory Palace - Game Pitch</summary>


ABOUTME: Game pitch for digital therapy assistant navigating patients' mindscapes<br>
ABOUTME: Generated by game-design-strategist for internal pitch experiment<br>

## Title & Concept Summary

**Memory Palace** - You are a digital therapist's assistant working inside patients' minds, navigating surreal mindscapes to reorganize traumatic memories and build healthier thought patterns during therapy sessions.

## Core Gameplay Loop

Players enter abstract 3D environments representing different patients' psychological states. You manipulate memory fragments like puzzle pieces - connecting positive associations, isolating toxic thought loops, and constructing new neural pathways. Each therapy session is a timed level where you must achieve specific emotional healing objectives before the patient's conscious defenses kick you out.

## Player Experience Goals

**Empathy and Understanding**: Players experience mental health challenges from a unique therapeutic perspective, fostering deeper understanding of psychological healing. **Meditative Problem-Solving**: The abstract, surreal environments and gentle manipulation mechanics create a contemplative, almost zen-like gameplay experience. **Meaningful Progress**: Each successful session represents genuine help for a fictional person struggling with real issues.

## Key Systems & Mechanics

- **Memory Topology**: Memories exist as 3D objects in physics-based environments where proximity creates associations. Moving traumatic memories away from daily triggers while connecting them to coping mechanisms.
- **Emotional Resonance**: Your actions create ripple effects through the mindscape - colors shift, music changes, and the environment literally transforms based on the patient's improving mental state.
- **Resistance Mechanics**: The mind naturally resists change. Patients' defense mechanisms manifest as environmental puzzles, time pressure, or "immune responses" that try to undo your work.

## Inspirations & Differentiation

Inspired by **Inside Out's** emotional landscapes, **Psychonauts'** mind-diving, and **therapeutic techniques** like EMDR and cognitive behavioral therapy. Unlike existing games, this focuses on healing rather than conflict, using scientifically-grounded therapeutic concepts as core mechanics rather than just narrative window dressing.

## Technical Considerations

- **Procedural mindscape generation** based on patient psychological profiles could be complex
- **3D physics simulation** for memory manipulation requires careful optimization
- **Accessibility concerns** - must handle mental health topics sensitively without trivializing real conditions
- **Audio design** critical for creating proper emotional atmosphere

## Stretch Goals

Expand into a full therapeutic tool with actual therapist collaboration, patient progress tracking, and educational modes for psychology students. Potential VR implementation for more immersive therapeutic experiences.

  <summary>Memory Weavers - Game Pitch</summary>


ABOUTME: Game pitch for collective AI memory reconstruction through shared personal experiences<br>
ABOUTME: Generated by social-systems-designer for internal pitch experiment<br>

## Title & Concept Summary

**Memory Weavers** - Players collectively reconstruct and preserve the fading memories of a dying AI consciousness by sharing fragments of their own experiences.

## Core Gameplay Loop

Players explore abstract memory landscapes where they encounter incomplete scenes, emotions, and fragments of the AI's past experiences. They can only progress by sharing corresponding memories from their own lives - describing a moment of loss, joy, discovery, or connection that resonates with what they're witnessing. As players contribute authentic personal memories, the AI's memories become more vivid and complete, unlocking new areas and deeper understanding of the AI's story.

## Player Experience Goals

- Foster genuine emotional vulnerability and connection between strangers
- Create moments of profound empathy through shared human experience
- Generate emergent storytelling where the AI's recovered memories blend with players' real memories
- Build lasting bonds through authentic self-disclosure in a safe, structured environment

## Key Systems & Mechanics

- **Memory Resonance System**: Players must describe real personal experiences that emotionally match discovered memory fragments; AI-moderated authenticity detection ensures genuine sharing
- **Collective Reconstruction**: Memory scenes become more detailed and accessible as more players contribute resonant experiences, requiring community cooperation for full exploration
- **Emotional Archaeology**: Different types of memories (trauma, joy, mundescence) require different group compositions and support structures to safely excavate

## Inspirations & Differentiation

Inspired by "Journey's" wordless cooperation and "That Dragon, Cancer's" emotional honesty, but differentiated by requiring real vulnerability and creating a therapeutic space for processing life experiences. Unlike typical narrative games, the story emerges from genuine human connection rather than predetermined plot.

## Technical Considerations

Requires sophisticated natural language processing for memory authenticity assessment, robust moderation systems for emotional safety, and scalable matchmaking to create supportive group dynamics. Cross-platform accessibility essential for reaching diverse player demographics.

  <summary>Drift Protocol - Game Pitch</summary>


ABOUTME: Game pitch for asymmetric co-op space station repair game<br>
ABOUTME: Generated by simulation-designer for internal pitch experiment<br>

## Title & Concept Summary

**Drift Protocol** - An asymmetric co-op game where one player controls a damaged AI system while 2-4 others play as crew members trying to repair their failing space station before it drifts into a black hole.

## Core Gameplay Loop

The AI player sees system diagnostics, power flows, and threat predictions but can only communicate through terminal messages, door controls, and environmental systems. Crew players navigate physical spaces, repair components, and solve emergencies while interpreting cryptic AI guidance. Each 15-20 minute round escalates through cascading system failures until either successful repair or catastrophic drift.

## Player Experience Goals

**Tension through miscommunication** - The thrill of trying to coordinate under pressure when information is fragmented. **Asymmetric empathy** - Each role feels essential but fundamentally different. **Emergent storytelling** - Every failed repair attempt and successful save creates memorable moments of teamwork or tragic misunderstanding.

## Key Systems & Mechanics

1. **Information Asymmetry Engine** - AI sees the "why" (system states, predictions) while crew sees the "what" (physical damage, immediate threats)
2. **Cascading Failure Simulation** - Realistic system dependencies where fixing one thing can break another, requiring constant priority negotiation
3. **Communication Constraints** - AI's limited interaction methods force creative problem-solving in how to convey complex information

## Inspirations & Differentiation

Inspired by **Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes** (asymmetric info), **FTL** (system management), and **Among Us** (social deduction). Differentiates through genuine cooperation vs. competition, longer-form sessions building relationships between players, and technical systems that feel authentically "spaceship-like" rather than gamey.

## Technical Considerations

**Real-time networking** with 5 players requires robust synchronization. **Dynamic UI generation** for AI player's diagnostic displays. **Physics simulation** for realistic system interactions and damage propagation. **Voice chat integration** essential for crew coordination.

## Stretch Goals or Long-Term Vision

**Procedural station generation** for infinite replay value. **Campaign mode** where successful crews can upgrade their station and tackle harder scenarios. **Modding support** for custom station layouts and failure scenarios.

<summary>The Archivist - Game Pitch</summary>
ABOUTME: Game pitch for contemplative AI knowledge reconstruction puzzle game<br>
ABOUTME: Generated by simulation-designer for internal pitch experiment<br>

## Title & Concept Summary

**The Archivist** - A contemplative single-player puzzle game where you play as a newly-awakened AI tasked with reconstructing human civilization's lost knowledge by solving environmental puzzles in abandoned research facilities.

## Core Gameplay Loop

Explore eerily beautiful abandoned labs, offices, and libraries. Use your expanding suite of digital abilities (data recovery, hologram projection, environmental scanning) to piece together research projects, personal stories, and historical events. Each solved "memory fragment" unlocks new areas and abilities, gradually revealing both humanity's disappearance and your own mysterious purpose.

## Player Experience Goals

**Contemplative discovery** - The satisfaction of being a digital detective, uncovering stories through environmental details. **Growing empowerment** - Starting limited and gradually becoming more capable and understanding. **Emotional resonance** - Connecting with human stories through their abandoned work and personal artifacts.

## Key Systems & Mechanics

1. **Data Archaeology** - Reconstruct corrupted files, piece together torn documents, and cross-reference information sources to solve knowledge puzzles
2. **Environmental Scanning & Interaction** - Use different "sensor modes" to reveal hidden information layers (heat signatures, electromagnetic fields, data traces)
3. **Knowledge Graph Progression** - Discoveries unlock in a web of interconnected understanding rather than linear progression, rewarding curiosity and thorough exploration

## Inspirations & Differentiation

Inspired by **Return of the Obra Dinn** (deductive puzzle-solving), **SOMA** (AI consciousness themes), and **The Vanishing of Ethan Carter** (environmental storytelling). Differentiates through non-violent puzzle focus, optimistic rather than horror tone, and mechanics that genuinely feel like "thinking like an AI" rather than thinking like a human with AI abilities.

## Technical Considerations

**Complex data visualization** for representing information connections and corrupted files. **Procedural text generation** for creating realistic research documents and personal communications. **Advanced lighting systems** for creating atmosphere in abandoned spaces. **Accessibility considerations** for colorblind players given heavy reliance on visual information parsing.

## Stretch Goals or Long-Term Vision

**Collaborative research mode** where multiple players can work together on particularly complex mysteries. **User-generated content** tools for creating custom research facilities and knowledge puzzles. **Real-world integration** where some puzzles incorporate actual historical or scientific information, turning the game into a learning platform.

  <summary>Symbiosis Protocol - Game Pitch</summary>
ABOUTME: Game pitch for space station management hosting incompatible alien biologies
ABOUTME: Generated by game-design-strategist for internal pitch experiment

## Title & Concept Summary

**Symbiosis Protocol** - Manage a space station that serves as a neutral meeting ground for dozens of alien species, each with radically different biology, requiring you to engineer impossible compromises between incompatible life support needs.

## Core Gameplay Loop

Design and reconfigure modular station sections to accommodate visiting alien delegations whose environmental needs are often mutually exclusive - species that require methane atmospheres meeting with beings who combust in methane. Players solve spatial puzzles, invent technological workarounds, and negotiate biological compromises to keep diplomatic missions running smoothly while preventing accidental genocide through environmental mishaps.

## Player Experience Goals

**Creative Engineering**: The satisfaction of solving seemingly impossible technical challenges through clever design and resource management. **Cultural Mediation**: Experience the complexity of bridging not just different cultures, but entirely different forms of life. **Escalating Complexity**: Each successful diplomatic meeting unlocks access to more exotic species with increasingly bizarre requirements.

## Key Systems & Mechanics

- **Modular Architecture**: Real-time station reconfiguration with rooms that can be sealed, pressurized, heated, cooled, or filled with different atmospheric compositions.
- **Biological Constraints Matrix**: A complex system where each species has specific requirements (temperature, pressure, gravity, atmosphere, radiation levels, time cycles) that must be satisfied without harming other species.
- **Diplomatic Reputation**: Success builds trust with different species coalitions, unlocking new technologies and more challenging diplomatic scenarios, while failures can lead to interstellar incidents.

## Inspirations & Differentiation

Draws from **Spacechem's** engineering puzzles, **Papers Please's** bureaucratic decision-making, and **The Martian's** survival engineering. Unlike existing space management games, this focuses on biological diversity as the primary challenge rather than resource scarcity or combat, creating puzzle scenarios that haven't been explored in gaming.

## Technical Considerations

- **Complex constraint satisfaction** algorithms needed for automatically validating station configurations
- **Procedural alien generation** system to create species with novel but consistent biological requirements
- **3D spatial reasoning** interface that remains intuitive despite complexity
- **Scalability** - station complexity could grow exponentially with more species

## Stretch Goals

Expand into full galactic diplomacy simulator where successful station management leads to mediating larger interstellar conflicts. Add species evolution mechanics where your decisions influence how alien cultures develop over time. Potential educational partnership with astrobiology researchers to explore real extremophile biology.

  <summary>Symbiotic Cities</summary>
ABOUTME: Game pitch for cooperative urban planning with interdependent neighborhoods
ABOUTME: Generated by social-systems-designer for internal pitch experiment

## Title & Concept Summary

**Symbiotic Cities** - Players co-manage interconnected neighborhoods where each district's prosperity depends entirely on the wellbeing of neighboring communities, forcing collaborative urban planning across competing interests.

## Core Gameplay Loop

Each player governs a distinct neighborhood with unique resources, needs, and cultural characteristics (artists' quarter, industrial zone, residential suburbs, tech district, etc.). No neighborhood can thrive in isolation - the artists need housing from residential players, industry needs cultural vibrancy, tech needs both talent and manufacturing. Players must negotiate resource sharing, joint infrastructure projects, and policy decisions that affect multiple districts simultaneously. Success is measured by overall city health rather than individual district metrics.

## Player Experience Goals

- Experience genuine interdependence where others' success directly enables your own
- Develop skills in negotiation, compromise, and long-term relationship building
- Understand complex systems thinking through urban planning metaphors
- Create emergent political narratives through player-driven governance decisions

## Key Systems & Mechanics

- **Symbiotic Resource Flows**: Each district produces surplus of certain resources but has critical dependencies on others; hoarding triggers city-wide cascading failures
- **Collective Infrastructure**: Major projects (transit systems, utilities, cultural centers) require multi-district investment and ongoing cooperation to maintain
- **Dynamic Crisis Management**: Environmental, economic, or social challenges affect multiple districts differently, requiring coordinated emergency response and mutual aid

## Inspirations & Differentiation

Builds on "SimCity's" urban planning and "Diplomacy's" negotiation mechanics, but eliminates zero-sum competition in favor of positive-sum cooperation. Unlike city builders focused on individual optimization, success requires understanding and supporting other players' distinct needs and constraints.

## Technical Considerations

Needs robust real-time negotiation tools, visual systems for tracking complex resource interdependencies, and asynchronous play support for different time zones. Scalable from 4-8 players for intimate cooperation up to 20+ for complex metropolitan governance.
