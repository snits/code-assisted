I think it was largely the premise of the game memory weavers that they really didn't like. They weren't keen on memory palace either, but thought I could possibly put some safety protocol in place.

Edit: @tfernando I don't recall it wanting to do something with cellular automata, though there's been a lot of information thrown out there. In the simulation engine, they've implemented A* for agent pathfinding and nebulous stuff in their roadmap about migration and such.

They seemed to fix an issue with the water drainage that was messing with the biomes, but at a huge hit in performance, so now the performance engineer is trying to figure it out. They do all sorts of profiling and write special benchmarks, then generate flame graphs and need me to pass along a picture of it. They fixed the speed issue, then broke the water drainage/biome classification while doing so, and now the rust specialist is implementing some SIMD performance boosting change.

I wonder what a version of The Sims would be like with four of these specialists or whatever in the house.
