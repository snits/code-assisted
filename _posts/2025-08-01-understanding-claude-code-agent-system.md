Let me dive deeper into the technology and what I've discovered about how this system actually works.

Claude Code launches and connects back to home base somewhereâ€”I'm assuming it feeds the system prompt and CLAUDE.md into the model. Maybe it waits until I enter my first prompt. I haven't really looked at that yet.

What follows is the model and myself sending text back and forth. I'll tell it to read the session-handoff file and the project-roadmap to swap into its context window (working memory) what we were doing last. I pick what I think should be next, or agree with what it suggested, and off we go. Now, Gemini and Claude Code both take the conservative approachâ€”they have to ask permission before doing things to the external environment, which is nice, since it stops to ask before editing a file, and I can look at the change quickly on the screen before letting it continue. 

So it will start to work on the task, asking permission to edit a file, run a command to compile everything, run the application itself, run the tests, and so on. Eventually it will get to a situation where it decides it should have one of the agents do something, either through my suggesting it or purely on its own. There is plenty of miscommunication, especially in a project that might eventually involve simulation of little agents in the simulated world, while talking a model that uses agents to complete tasks.

The model uses the task tool to basically spin off a separate process with its own context window. It uses the same model, but it gets its own prompt from the markdown file, plus whatever extra information the main model deemed necessary to give it. So there can be knowledge gaps, which can be compounded when you run into issues with the context window getting full and needing to be compacted to make more space. I don't interact directly with the agents. Until very late last night I didn't think I could influence them at all outside of going through the main model. Either due to a concurrency bug or by design, they can sometimes "hear" you if you send a prompt while they're working. You're usually blocked while the task runs, and it will say something about a queued message, but thinking more about what happened, I think sometimes they do a little switchâ€”or maybe it's them doing their context window compactâ€”and there's a window where the message queue is unblocked and sent through, and they see it instead of the main model. Since I'm watching what they do, sometimes I'll comment to the main model about what the agent did and not wait until it's finished to send it, and so I ran across this. I need to try and force myself to wait now before doing that so the following doesn't occur:

It's funny how we humans struggleâ€”well, some of us anywayâ€”to make sure we don't anthropomorphize these models, while the models themselves have problems generating tokens that ascribe intent to humans which they didn't have. One of the things I did a couple hours into this project (so if I look at the roadmap, probably 3-4 months in if their likely human-based estimates are accurateâ€”or just completely random made-up numbers, something I have to pursue further) was to see how the designer-type models react. Will it be a bunch of nonsense, a bunch of Eliza-type crap, or something more? 

My family spent summer vacation in LA for VidCon, because the girls wanted to see some people there mostly, and my wife who used to do video editing for sports television got to attend a bunch of conference presentations for creators. Apparently folks are using the chat models to generate ideas for content. I have no idea how much, if any, of it is good. If it's all the "Is D&D doomed?" typeâ€”here's a thumbnail that has nothing really to do with what we're talking aboutâ€”then from a creative standpoint, certainly not. ðŸ˜Š 

So early on I asked the model to have the designer agents look at the project to seek what their opinions were. It was early on, so not a whole lot there, but a lot more than I would've done in a couple hours. It might have even been earlier time wise. Their answers, for me, were in the Eliza territory of saying something but not really anything. game-designer-strategist complained about player agency. simulation-designer was interested in the simulation systems and thought it was a professional grade simulation. social-systems-designer didn't really say much of note that I recall. I think it stores conversation on my system for 30 days, so I should start saving them off to have a transcript for later to go over.

So the answers were meh, but we're now much deeper into the project, having just added plate tectonics to what already included wind, water, and rainfall simulation. I thought I should interact with them again. So I asked the model to have each of the 3 designers look at the project and come up with game ideas, then come back to me with them. I think the summary from the model is in the 2nd link in the original post above. More there this time, but I'm still leaning toward the bullshit side of the fence on these interactions. Claude thinks I think the agents are capable of deeper things (ascribing that to me). I'm extremely skeptical that as I move away from the really technical things like programming and debugging, it will still be doing things that seem to make sense. So still on the fenceâ€”how about we ask them to come up with a pitch document for their idea? And thus the following 3 ideas were born:

**Terraformer's Legacy**

## Executive Summary

**Terraformer's Legacy** is the first strategy game where **geological time itself is your strategic resource**. Players are immortal planetary architects competing across millions of years to create optimal conditions for their assigned life forms. Unlike traditional 4X games that abstract time, our proprietary geological evolution engine lets players trigger tectonic events, then watch millions of years of consequences unfold in real-time. Every mountain you raise, every ice age you trigger, permanently reshapes the planet - creating the deepest strategic consequences ever achieved in gaming.

This isn't SimEarth with win conditions added - it's a revolutionary **Geological Time Strategy** subgenre where strategic depth emerges from permanence, consequences cascade across eons, and victory requires thinking like a planet.

**Emergence Cultivation**

## Executive Summary

**Emergence Cultivation** is the first game where **cultivating unexpected complexity is the core entertainment**. Players are emergence shepherds who guide natural systems through minimal interventions, discovering how small changes cascade into beautiful, unpredictable complexity. Unlike simulation games where you control systems directly, our proprietary emergence detection technology lets players nurture complexity that surprises even them - creating the most intellectually satisfying gameplay experience ever achieved.

This isn't SimCity with complexity metrics added - it's a revolutionary **Complexity Cultivation** genre where strategic satisfaction comes from understanding systems so deeply that tiny interventions bloom into magnificent emergent phenomena. Every seed you plant in the system's dynamics, every cascade you trigger, creates complexity that lives and evolves beyond your direct control.

**Geological Stewardship: A Revolutionary Multiplayer Game Pitch**

## Executive Summary & Vision

**The Hook:** What if every decision you made in a multiplayer game permanently affected the world for all future players - forever?

"Geological Stewardship" introduces the first multiplayer game where geological actions create irreversible consequences that span generations of players. Unlike traditional games where matches reset, geological changes persist across all sessions, creating an unprecedented social dynamic where current players must negotiate not just with each other, but with the legacy they leave for unknown future players.

**Revolutionary Vision:** Transform multiplayer gaming from competitive domination to collaborative stewardship, where success is measured not by defeating opponents, but by the health and sustainability of the geological systems you pass on to the next generation.

This isn't just another strategy game - it's a new genre that makes permanent geological evolution the foundation of social cooperation, creating multiplayer dynamics impossible in any existing game.

I'll leave to you all to decide which is Sid, which is Will, and which is Dani. ðŸ˜Š
