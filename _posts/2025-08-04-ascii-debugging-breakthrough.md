Did the little bastards pull it off?

Ah, nope, there's still an issue in the pressure system, but I was able to see the problem occur. The world started out like that, then was getting more and more little lake areas with forest around them until finally this clamping thing with the pressure hit, and poofâ€”lake water world with polar caps. So they still have some debugging to do. I wonder where CFD guy got his PhD. Actually, I guess CFD guy is right about the problems; the code geeks just need to fix it right. So I take it back, physics guy.
