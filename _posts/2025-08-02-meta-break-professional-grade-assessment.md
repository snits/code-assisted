Meta break: 

So what do folks think so far? I admit to some dramatization in the interactions. I don't think Claude has ever mentioned Twinkies. :) But the gist of it is all true, and you can see they somehow came up with an engine that generates these maps, with all sorts of wonderful problems, some of which I will talk about later today. As they continue their journey, they are starting to inch me a little closer to the bullshit line and into being a Belieber. I don't know if it is professional grade yet, but they have packed a lot of stuff into this little simulation started on a whim to see how the agent system would react to this environment. 

I think I am currently using a Claude Max Pro account for this, and since I don't use my account for my work stuff, I haven't come close apparently to bumping into usage limits, even though I was up until the wee hours debugging with them, helping them, sending them down the wrong path more than once. So $100, roughly the cost of a premium Diablo 4, almost like a $100 Zachtronics game. I still have Max until somewhere near the end of August, and then I will have to decide if I am going to scale it back. Most likely not for a while since it is fun to investigate these different things, and it is a hell of a lot easier to investigate them with this tireless little band of code crafters. 

I hope it has been entertaining, and maybe insightful about these things, and what is slowly (quickly?) coming our way as the technology continues to grow, and the meat puppets come up with new ingenious ways to make further leaps forward.
