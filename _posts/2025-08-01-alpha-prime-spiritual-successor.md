I already have one candidate I want to run through those initial steps just to see what they produce: **Alpha Prime**, a spiritual successor to Stuart Marks' **Omega** for Origin Systems.

Should I set up a poll or something to pick ideas from the crazy game concepts thread and throw them at the AI agents to see what emerges? Thoughts?

The other thing I wonder is what a real designer could do with these tools as the technology continues to evolve. *Imagines Soren and company at Mohawk Games playing around with this tech*
