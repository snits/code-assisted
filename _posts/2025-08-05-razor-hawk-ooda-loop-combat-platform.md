The design gets extended a bit:

Apparently, looking at the instructions they are adding, I'll be able to task one with my old job of being a jammer.

Here is one of the armored commander AI agent's programs that they named **RAZOR HAWK**:

```
# RAZOR HAWK - OODA Loop Combat Platform
# Military Designation: Fast-reaction interdiction unit
# Tactical Doctrine: OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) with decision tempo control
# Mission: Maintain decision superiority through rapid tactical cycles

# OODA Loop Phase 1: OBSERVE - Comprehensive battlefield awareness
VAR close_threat = PROXIMITY_SCAN()
VAR distant_threat = ACTIVE_RADAR()
VAR current_health = GET_HEALTH()
VAR heat_status = GET_HEAT()

# OODA Loop Phase 2: ORIENT - Assess tactical situation
VAR threat_priority = 0
VAR tactical_stance = 0

# Threat assessment and orientation
IF close_threat > 0 THEN
    threat_priority = 3  # Immediate threat
ELSE
    IF distant_threat > 0 THEN
        threat_priority = 2  # Potential threat
    ELSE
        threat_priority = 1  # No contact
    END IF
END IF

# Determine tactical stance based on health and heat
IF current_health > 70 AND heat_status < 50 THEN
    tactical_stance = 3  # Aggressive
ELSE
    IF current_health > 40 THEN
        tactical_stance = 2  # Balanced
    ELSE
        tactical_stance = 1  # Defensive
    END IF
END IF

# OODA Loop Phase 3: DECIDE - Rapid decision matrix
IF threat_priority == 3 THEN
    # Close threat - immediate action required
    IF tactical_stance > 1 THEN
        # Engage decisively
        FIRE_WEAPON
        TURN_RIGHT 30
        MOVE_FORWARD 20
    ELSE
        # Break contact
        FIRE_WEAPON
        MOVE_BACKWARD 35
    END IF
ELSE
    IF threat_priority == 2 THEN
        # Distant threat - control engagement
        IF tactical_stance == 3 THEN
            # Close and engage
            MOVE_FORWARD 40
            FIRE_WEAPON
        ELSE
            # Maneuver for advantage
            TURN_LEFT 45
            MOVE_FORWARD 25
        END IF
    ELSE
        # No immediate threat - maintain tempo
        MOVE_FORWARD 35
        TURN_RIGHT 60
    END IF
END IF

# OODA Loop Phase 4: ACT - Execute with speed
# Rapid reassessment for decision tempo
close_threat = PROXIMITY_SCAN()
IF close_threat > 0 AND heat_status < 70 THEN
    # Opportunity fire
    FIRE_WEAPON
END IF
```

I did a search on Google to see if there was some other game or an old Omega fansite with this, but the initial search turned up nothing. They still need to implement a couple language constructs, so it doesn't benefit from being able to create functions yet. That is a simplistic OODA loop though. Unfortunately for him, without using a looping construct or functions, his decision cycle really isn't more rapid than the next guy. Right now he will zip through these instructions and then sit until the next tick. I need to talk to the team about this again. Maybe it should loop back to the top and keep going until his instruction budget is used.
