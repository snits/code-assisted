Visual comparison shots as we prepare to pivot in another direction.

## Terminal UI Implementation

The ASCII output shows biome distribution using the current tectonics system:

## Algorithm Comparison: Tectonics vs Diamond-Square

The current issue with our tectonics implementation:

Compared to the diamond-square algorithm output:

The visual debugging clearly shows the difference in terrain generation quality between these two approaches. The diamond-square algorithm produces more natural-looking terrain patterns, while our current tectonics implementation shows artificial boundaries that need refinement.
