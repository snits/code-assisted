I have watched them debug a couple register allocation issues, some kind of endian issue where they were and'ing the lower 8 bits of something when they needed to shift down 16. Wtf am I watching here lol. And now we have robotic violence taking place, at least in memory. They have finished wiring up the GUI so I can watch and get the initial tournament support in so I can run the bots against each other. Time to see if the officer or the language designer has the better chops.

To finally get to the bottom of the compiler issue, it was solved by the path forward from here: "If you give me a prompt for a compiler expert, I will give you a compiler expert" - an army of memento dudes with Neo's "I know kung fu" training interface, basically.
