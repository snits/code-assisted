The base subscription at Anthropic is $20 a month, I believe, and would be more than enough to start with. Someone else might have some ideas on local model stuff if you have the hardware to handle it, but I honestly think $20 for 1 month to see what it does is a great price. I don't know what the terminal-type tools like Claude Code are like on a Windows system. There also is something called Cursor that is a fork of VSCode, and I think gives access to models. It certainly does for the enterprise folks. I have no idea on the pricing or its capabilities. I mainly played with Google Gemini inside gemini-cli and my personal account for Claude Code. And feel free to chime in and ask questions. It is a learning process for me, which is part of the fun of the journey, and maybe I can post some of what it has to do to show you examples of whether or not it might help with getting used to programming again. I'd told it to explain what it is doing and why as it is going, and to dump into deep dive documents the math and concepts behind. I still haven't had time to read through everything it is dumping out, let alone fact check it, so it will be interesting to see what all it had to say.

I should add that most of the discussion transcripts so far are me recollecting what took place, though it would be funny if I had them talking like that and calling me 'meat puppet dude'.
