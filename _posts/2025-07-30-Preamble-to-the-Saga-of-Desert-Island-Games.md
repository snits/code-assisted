# Preamble to the Saga of Desert Island Games



The posts dated from July 31st, 2025 - August 10th, 2025 originated from a series of forum posts on the Quarter to Three gaming forums. They chronicle the first two weeks or so of me exploring code assist technologies, in particular those that you can use within the confines of your terminal. It started partially as a task at work where we initially had access to Google Gemini, but on my own I purchased a subscription to Anthropic's Claude Code to see how it worked as well. A day later, Anthropic released their support for sub-agents. Being unable to use the tool to explore code in our repositories yet, I embarked on a journey of first one, and then another toy project to explore the use of the agents in coding further. The result of that is the continuing story of a fake, little, virtual game studio named Desert Island Games. A couple of the posts have bits responding to other members of the forum, and the first 2 posts on the 31st of July began life in a different thread of the forum. Post #3 was the start of a thread titled **Software Manager: The Game**. The resolution of the images in these posts is also pretty much crap at the moment. I need to see if there is a way to download the original, full-sized image so I can place those in here. There is a lot of arguing about the meaning of what these models are capable of, whether they are intelligent, and whether they will eventually lead to AGI. At Desert Island Games, we are taking a break from all that to just have some fun, explore the boundaries of what is possible with these things via prompt manipulation, and possibly make something neat. So enjoy their adventures. Oh, one more note: Pay no attention to the weighty titles they've chosen to give the posts as they added the front matter to prepare them all for Jekyll. No matter how much I try to reel them in, they love trying to make things sound fancy.
