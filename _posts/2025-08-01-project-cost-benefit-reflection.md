Yeah, I probably should've worded it differently—probably go around a few times with a chat model to come up with a prompt to try next time.

Starting with a core and iterating quickly on a prototype is something I will definitely try. This has just kind of morphed as it continues, from a lark to see what they would do when I put this crazy document about the simulation stuff in there and had them process it.

The one place right now that I know isn't 100% pure bullshit (maybe just 90% lol) is the biome classification system it's working on at the moment, or at least it talked a good game mentioning Robert Whittaker before I brought up Whittaker and his book.

It would be interesting to have someone that actually works on simulation code look at what it's doing. They certainly talk a good game, but talk is talk.

It has planned out a 14-section plan to walk through the code and concepts with me for the first 4 phases of the project. Is there a way to have foldable markdown documents in here? I would put some of the documents in here, but

Edit: that is a good idea about the internal pitch thing, though. I will have to come up with a prompt and tell the model to have the designers hash out a set of ideas—doesn't have to be tied to this simulation code—and then agree on a ranked list of the ideas. Maybe I'll try that when I get back from my walk.
