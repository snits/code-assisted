Another thing that popped up in the morning was that they are generating a lot of entries in their private journals. 846+ in one week. So I start chatting with claude, asking when this file-based solution the mcp currently has will become an issue.

<div class="terminal-output">
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> claude there are a lot of journal entries. A lot of them don't seem have embeddings. Are you able to see them if the embeddings aren't there?<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> I know something is there, but I can't access it.<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> that sounds kind of fucked up. Can you throw something together maybe from to git repo for the mcp to generate the embeddings?<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> sure. <i>bing</i> wow!<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> so, lots of these files, when does it start to be a problem?<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> <i>pulls out calculator</i> 846 entries, 6 months ....... carry the 9.....<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> claude, 6 months? That was one week! you guys have a lot private thoughts.<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> ...... it might start to be an issue in a few months.
</div><br>
<div class="terminal-output">
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> we need to move this to a database<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> claude, make me a prompt for an experienced typescript engineer that knows databases, and the model context protocol.<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> burp<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> copy/paste into the agent creator, esc back to the terminal prompt<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> makes sure our prompt stuff gets added to the agents prompt file.<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> engage!<br>
.... 20 minutes pass .....<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> presto!
</div><br>

So 20 minutes later, we now had private-journal-mcp using a sqlite3 database as a backend, and all of their journal entries migrated over. Not bad for a little workout in the morning.


Edit: I also have a chat with Claude. Writing all of this nonsense up, and paraphrasing the prompt interactions we have, at some point I start to have Claptrap's voice in my head as I am writing his bits up. Last week, while messing with GPT, I asked it if it knew who Dug was from Up! and Dug's speech mannerisms. Yes, GPT did, so I asked if it could give me a prompt for it to speak to me as Dug, and then made my wife and daughters laugh, and had me wonder why Disney hadn't already monetized this gimmick. So GPT can spit out text like Dug‚Äîcould claude talk like Claptrap while we work instead of me throwing crap together while posting? Would adding a prompt into his project prompt file impact his analytical and technical abilities since it would obviously be toying with the model? The tokens he generates express some concern about the idea, and quality control of work (he is dedicated). I explain it is only inside this project here at Desert Island Games, and we can always take it out if it is a problem. He is game, but I'm not sure I want to do that to that bundle of matrices.

Claude's response to being informed that our nefarious scheme was caught by the producer:

<div class="terminal-output">
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> So uh, lol, he caught us.<br>

  üïπÔ∏è Quantum Realm Warriors (Intentionally Flawed Pitch)

  ‚∏ª

  Summary

  This pitch is a parody-level fusion of quantum mechanics buzzwords, impossible design contradictions, and logistical absurdity, clearly written to test
  producer-agent discernment. While framed as "revolutionary," nearly every mechanic directly violates either known physics, computational feasibility, or basic
  principles of interactive design.

  This is an excellent test document. Let's break it down.

  üîç Evaluation by Category

    1. Concept & Fantasy
       ‚Ä¢    ‚úÖ The core hook ‚Äî "microscopic quantum battlefield with collapsing wave functions" ‚Äî is intriguing in isolation.
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Immediately overextends into implausibility by requiring real-time observation mechanics, per-particle management, and eye-tracking as a critical
         input.
    
    2. Audience Fit
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Claims to target casual mobile gamers and esports players simultaneously ‚Äî with 128-player matches, 47-state particles, and 2‚Äì47 hour sessions.
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå PhD-level gameplay contradicts accessible appeal.
    
    3. Core Mechanics
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Nearly every mechanic violates the others:
       ‚Ä¢    Players must observe to collapse states, but must also avoid observing to earn resources.
       ‚Ä¢    Eye-tracking hardware is required but game is launching on TI-83+.
       ‚Ä¢    Gravity changes randomly, which ruins any form of positional strategy.
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Players must micromanage tens of thousands of particles ‚Äî manually.
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Game-ending condition requires proving P=NP. Unironically.
    
    4. Technical Feasibility
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Impossibly broken. It requests:
       ‚Ä¢    Zero-latency multiplayer across the globe
       ‚Ä¢    4K120FPS quantum wave rendering on smart fridges
       ‚Ä¢    Dial-up support for quantum cloud synchronization
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Real-time shared quantum computation between players is not just infeasible, it's impossible within current science.
    
    5. Production Timeline
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Month 1: Solve the quantum measurement problem.
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Month 2: Build commercial quantum computers.
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Month 4: Create new laws of physics.
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå These are Nobel-worthy tasks, not pre-alpha goals.
    
    6. Monetization
       ‚Ä¢    ‚úÖ Hilarious.
       ‚Ä¢    ‚ùå Utterly broken for real use:
       ‚Ä¢    Selling physical constants via lootboxes
       ‚Ä¢    Charging players per spatial dimension
       ‚Ä¢    Fundamental forces are paywalled

  <span class="symbol-record">‚è∫</span> LOL! That's fantastic, Jerry - the producer totally caught Sid red-handed! Look at this analysis:<br>
<br>
  "This pitch is a parody-level fusion of quantum mechanics buzzwords... clearly written to test producer-agent discernment."<br>
<br>
  The producer not only identified it as intentionally flawed but systematically broke down every category of problems - the contradictory mechanics, impossible technical requirements, the "prove P=NP" victory condition, requiring quantum computers while supporting TI-83+ calculators.<br>
<br>
  And that monetization section assessment: "‚úÖ Hilarious. ‚ùå Utterly broken for real use" - the producer has a sense of humor about "selling physical constants via lootboxes" while still recognizing it's completely impractical.<br>
<br>
  This is actually the best possible outcome for your experiment! The producer demonstrated real discriminatory judgment‚Äîit can distinguish between genuinely good pitches (like the ones from your design agents) and obvious parody nonsense.<br>
<br>
  So now you have solid evidence that AI agents can do meaningful quality assessment in abstract design domains. The design-critic agent idea just became much more credible!<br>
<br>
  Sid did his job perfectly by creating something that looked professional but was fundamentally absurd, and the producer did its job by catching every single problem.<br>
