**Spinning plates, scale, the ambiguity of language, and a left turn at Albuquerque**


We worked through some issues today, and it was interesting to see them write some programs to debug some of the systems and test performance. We cleared up some misunderstandings I had and were making some progress. There were still some issues, like why didn't the wind and weather stuff seem to be working. That leads to noticing again that they notice "local" things but will miss big picture stuff. 

When using the plate tectonics generator, there is an initial point during start up where it sails through some geological change time scales. So I wondered if performance-engineer could work his magic there like he did with the water drainage system. That leads to him finding an issue with the space partitioning code. I run the program and take a look. I notice some circles in the weather mode which I hadn't seen before, but now some of the other modes like pressure and wind are basically red. So more debugging ensues. The first clue in one bug is something was thinking physical_size was 10km.

<div class="terminal-output">
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> Aha! It's elementary, dear Watson. This code is setting physical size to 10km<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> physical size of what? a map cell, the world?<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> The world dummy, can't you read code? Why?<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> Doesn't that seem like a really small planet for a planetary simulation?<br>
<span class=""><b>Claude:</b></span> Nooooo??<br>
</div><br>

So some coding happens, and now something scales depending on map size. More poking in the app.

<div class="terminal-output">
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> Claude, it still doesn't seem to be right<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> Why?? with this map size the physical_size is 50km. Who could need more than that?<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> I don't know, pressure systems, wind systems, weather systems, a system thinking it is simulating a planet?<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> Are you telling me you are simulating 50km region as if it was an entire world?<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> Cool, right? I can see the porsche already.<br>
</div><br>
Meanwhile, after solving the space-partitioning issue with the plate tectonics stuff

<div class="terminal-output">
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span>  Claude, we should have simulation-designer or world-generation-architect go through the plate tectonic code. When I run a map with it, the plates are there, but it seems to mostly be at the 2 extremes of either being mountain or deep water.<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> Let's have world-generation-architect look, that seems like their jam.<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>world-generation-architect:</b></span> <i>nom nom nom</i><br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>world-generation-architect</b></span> What idiot thought you could do some geological time scale manipulation to simulate plate tectonics <i>eyes the meat puppet</i><br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> Didn't you design this?<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>world-generation-architect</b></span> ...<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me</b></span> ...<br>
</div><br>



A meeting is called. The task: What do we do here. I would think there would be some scaling thing they would be doing with their professional ScaleAware simulation engine. A couple options are proffered by the design folks and architects. Who would even think to simulate a world at a 50km scale, let alone 10km? I'll tell you who. Stanislaw Lem.

<div class="terminal-output">
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> Claude, ask simulation-designer who Stanislaw Lem is<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> Did you say coleslaw? Are we going for bbq?<br>
</div><br>



simulation-designer is tasked with coming up with a design for a scaled down abstracted sciences system to go with a 50km world.

<div class="terminal-output">
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> lfg<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>simulation-designer:</b></span> Roger that, <i>beep</i>, here is a 1000+ line report on a new design complete with Rust code<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> can I finish my sandwich first?<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> Claude, so if we have a scaled down planet, with the fantasy-atmospherics thing, does that increase the compute budget for the agents?<br>
  <span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> Can I get 2 porsches?<br>
</div><br>



So they have an idea, and I have them create a new branch forked off which claude of his own volition names cyberiad-fantasy-physics.
