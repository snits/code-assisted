<div class="terminal-output">
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> claude, is the code base already set up to do the plug and play fantasy physics thing, and the agent stuff as well, and what is happening that we have an instance of the engine in which you've instantiated agents and there is no real constraint at all? Can we please re-organize the files in the project to make the organization explicitly clear? kthxbye<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> sure thing dude. presto!<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Me:</b></span> yeah this is much better, who wouldn't want super::scale::WorldScale, and super::optimized_heightmap?<br>
<span class="symbol-info"><b>Claude:</b></span> <i>not thinking it is funny</i> can we work on something please?<br>
</div><br>
